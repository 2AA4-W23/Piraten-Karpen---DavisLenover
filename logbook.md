2023-01-09: Created logbook and begun overview of project. Completed up to task #1 of Step 2. I will leave my answers for now and as the project further progresses, make further changes.
2023-01-10: Implemented player object and added all necessary components to which a player of the game would need (dice, rolling dice, the result of said roll, adding points, subtracting points). As a result, F01 and F02 are complete
2023-01-11: Continued to work on the player class. I ended up deciding on using ArrayList instead of just regular arrays as my initial design ideas included dynamically adding a removing things (such as Dice) from arrays, so to save time it makes more sense to use ArrayLists. Some code had to be changed to accommodate ArrayLists
2023-01-11 (2): Almost all features still needed to be implemented are implemented. Going to run some quick tests to make sure that the features are working as intended before marking as completed with tags. For now, pushing my work.
